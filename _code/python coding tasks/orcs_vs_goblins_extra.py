'''

Riding on the massive breakout success of your first game, Orcs
Vs. Goblins, your team dives right into developing its sequel:
Creature Clash. This new game features many new creature types... as
well as the classic goblins:

>>> goby = Goblin('Goby')
>>> goby.name
'Goby'

Like all creatures in this game, Goblins have attributes for their
hitpoints, attack damage, and defensive armor.

>>> goby.hitpoints
10
>>> goby.damage
3
>>> goby.armor
1

Of course, your fan base will rebel if you don't also have orcs. Like
before, they're a bit tougher:

>>> morgash = Orc('Morgash')
>>> morgash.name
'Morgash'
>>> morgash.hitpoints
15
>>> morgash.damage
5
>>> morgash.armor
2

And now we introduce HillOrcs, who are even tougher (but with a
weakness you'll learn about later):

>>> narbul = HillOrc('Narbul')
>>> narbul.name
'Narbul'
>>> narbul.hitpoints
20
>>> narbul.damage
5
>>> narbul.armor
3

There's also skeletons, who don't have any armor at all:

>>> bonez = Skeleton('Bonez')
>>> bonez.name
'Bonez'
>>> bonez.hitpoints
8
>>> bonez.damage
4
>>> bonez.armor
0

And finally, Ewoks. Who are tiny, but pack a punch (by
creating clever, devastating traps):

>>> teebo = Ewok('Teebo')
>>> teebo.name
'Teebo'
>>> teebo.hitpoints
4
>>> teebo.damage
10
>>> teebo.armor
1

Each of these inherit from a class called Creature. In writing your
code, be sure to put as many methods and member variables as possible
in this base class, overriding in the subclass when necessary.

>>> isinstance(goby, Creature)
True
>>> isinstance(morgash, Creature)
True
>>> isinstance(narbul, Creature)
True
>>> isinstance(bonez, Creature)
True
>>> isinstance(teebo, Creature)
True

You can check whether a creature is alive:

>>> bonez.is_alive()
True
>>> bonez.hitpoints = 0
>>> bonez.is_alive()
False
>>> bonez.hitpoints = 8
>>> bonez.is_alive()
True

The hitpoints, damage and armor values come into play when the
creatures fight.  The total damage done is equal to the attacker's
"damage" value, minus the target's "armor" value. The attack() method
returns the net damage done:

>>> goby.hitpoints
10
>>> bonez.hitpoints
8
>>> bonez.attack(goby)
3
>>> goby.hitpoints
7

Skeletons have no armor, so they take the full impact!
>>> goby.attack(bonez)
3
>>> bonez.hitpoints
5

When there's more than one creature to fight, an attacker has to
choose. Goblins and Ewoks simply choose the first one in the list:

>>> creatures = [narbul, goby, teebo, bonez, morgash]
>>> target = goby.select_target(creatures)
>>> target.name
'Narbul'
>>> target = teebo.select_target(creatures)
>>> target.name
'Narbul'

Skeletons are more devious and opportunistic. They will choose the
creature in the list with the fewest hit points:

>>> target = bonez.select_target(creatures)
>>> target.name
'Teebo'

Orcs (including Hill Orcs) are more complex. First, they won't attack
other orcs at all... unless there's no one to attack *except* an
orc. And among those it's willing to attack, it will pick the one with
the worst armor:

>>> target = narbul.select_target(creatures)
>>> target.name
'Bonez'
>>> target = morgash.select_target(creatures)
>>> target.name
'Bonez'

If there's no one to attack BUT orcs, then an orc will happily attack
the one with the worst (lowest) armor:

>>> only_orcs = [narbul, morgash]
>>> another_orc = Orc('Nashba')
>>> target = another_orc.select_target(only_orcs)
>>> target.name
'Morgash'

Hill Orcs have a weakness. Though strong and tough, they are TERRIFIED of
skeletons. If they attack one, fear reduces their muscles to jelly, and they do
no damage at all:

>>> bonez.hitpoints
5
>>> narbul.attack(bonez)
0
>>> narbul.attack(bonez)
0
>>> narbul.attack(bonez)
0
>>> bonez.hitpoints
5
